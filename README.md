# Cat-Cafe
This is a simple GUI project built in Java JDK 17, using IntelliJ as a class project.

 The project was to make a simple interface that simulates the layout of a hypothetical Cat Cafe.
 
 There is a grid of empty tiles at the start. When you select one of the multiple choice bubbles below the grid then click on a grid tile it will change to a that type of tile. Except for "View" that is a special selection that allows the user to get information about a tile when it is selected. Each tile type costs money to add, and costs money to maintain in the grid. The animals have a weekly countdown and when they hit 0 the animal is adopted and a new instance of that animal arrives in that spot. Information about the simulator can be seen in the top panel.
 
 The "Next Week" button, or the 'r' key will increment the weekly counter and calculate any changes to the simulator that happen. Clicking any of the "#x#" buttons will reset and resize the simiulator to that size. Hitting any of the number keys will resize and reset it as well to that key size.
